# Class 9 (Monday, Feb. 8, 2016)

Finally we'll start talking today about Python -- one of the most common programming languages used in newsrooms and the tool we'll be using this semester to deal with most of our advanced data journalism tasks.

We'll need to cover the basics first, most of which are outlined [here](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/resources/command_line_basics.md). So that's how we'll be spending the next several days.

We'll also talk a little about your final projects, the first part of which will be due on Friday.
