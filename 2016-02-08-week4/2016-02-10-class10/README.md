# Class 9 (Monday, Feb. 8, 2016)

More Python basics. Today we'll talk about variables, various Python data types and hopefully start moving on to control structures like if/else statement and loops.

Again, feel free to follow along in the [Python basics guide](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/resources/command_line_basics.md).

And please turn in your final project memos by Friday.
