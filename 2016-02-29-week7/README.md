# Week 7 (Feb. 29, 2016)

This week we're going to start talking about web scraping -- though without (yet) diving into the Python code. As we start going over some of the basics, these resources might come in handy:

  - [The request/response cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response) (Wikipedia)
  - [More about the request/response cycle](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) (Written for humans)
  - [Codecademy HTML/CSS basics](https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/htmlcss)

Also, following up on some of the git questions from the last couple weeks, these guides covering git basics might be helpful as well:

  - [Git -- the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)
  - [Learn Git in 20 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE)
