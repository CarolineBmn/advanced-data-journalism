# Analysis assignment (Nov. 16)

Your next assignment will be to use the tools we learned over the last several weeks to analyze data using Python.

Specifically, you'll use agate (or any other Python-based analysis tools you're familiar/comfortable with) to produce a Jupyter notebook outlining one solid story idea from a dataset.

Show your work. All of the steps you take to arrive at your story idea should be outlined in working code within the notebook. The idea itself should be explained in 200-300 words and included in the notebook as a Markdown cell.

Two datasets have been included here: one on campus crime and another on campus hate crime from 2011-2013. Documentation for the CSV files has also been included. Feel free to use these for your analysis. If you have a dataset of your own that you'd prefer to analyze, you can use that as well.

The assignment will be due in two weeks, on Wednesday, Dec. 2. It will be worth double the amount of a standard assignment.
