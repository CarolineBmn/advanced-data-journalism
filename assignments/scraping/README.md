# Scraping assignment (Oct. 9)

This time your task will be to write a simple scraper to grab live election night data from the Missouri Secretary of State. What's especially cool about this project is that it's modeled off of something a couple former students did last year for [the Missourian](http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/interactive-map-missouri-general-election-results/article_b9eede11-1256-5d88-9830-157f801ed7ac.html) (it looks a little busted now with the site redesign).

Specifically, you'll be asked to scrape all the county-by-county results for the 2014 state auditor's race (the only statewide race on the ballot that year) and save them to a CSV.

You can find the data by going to [this page](http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/), changing the "Choose Race" box to the auditor's race, then hitting the "Submit" button.

Again, once you're done, you should check the results into your Github account, using either a new repository or a single repository dedicated to all of your assignments. The assignment will be due next Monday, Oct. 19.
