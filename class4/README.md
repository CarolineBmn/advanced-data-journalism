# Class 4 (Monday, Aug. 31, 2015)

We'll be continuing our lesson from Friday on navigating your computer using the [command line](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/class3/command-line-basics.md).

Again, if you're using a Mac, you might want to download a copy of [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/). And if you're using Windows, you should download and install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/).
