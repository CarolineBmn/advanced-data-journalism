# Final Project (Spring Semester 2016)

At the end of the semester, you'll be expected to complete and present a final project using the skills you've learned in this class (and any other data journalism class you've taken).

This project can take one of three forms:

  - A CAR-driven story, relying on original data and analysis.
  - A data visualization or interactive project for the Web (but be aware that if you do this, we're not going to cover the frontend elements of data viz in this class).
  - A tool that in some way helps with the production of news

Or, of course, any other good idea you come up with.

We'll be working on these projects throughout the semester. Your first deadline will be **Friday, Feb. 12**, when we'll expect you to turn in a short memo with three ideas of projects you'd like to pursue. Mike and I will then review your memos and approve one of those projects for you to work on.

From there, we'll ask you to turn in regular progress updates every two weeks. We'll determine further deadlines later in the semester.
