<a id="welcome-to-advanced-data-journalism" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-advanced-data-journalism" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to Advanced Data Journalism.</h3>

<p>The goal of this class is to teach you how to creatively solve problems in journalism using computer programming. In it, you will learn how to use the Python language, statistics and advanced spreadsheet and database concepts, then apply those skills to real-world exercises. At the end of the semester, you will have been exposed to most of the skills required to do advanced data journalism in a newsroom environment.</p>

<a id="attendance-and-punctuality" class="anchor" href="#attendance-and-punctuality" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attendance and punctuality</h3>

<h3>
<a id="academic-honesty" class="anchor" href="#academic-honesty" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Academic honesty</h3>

<p>Academic honesty is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person's work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful.</p>

<p>Academic misconduct includes but is not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use of news or story content from another author without citation or attribution.</li>
<li>Use of verbatim content from another author without citation or attribution.</li>
<li>Extensive use of materials from past assignments without permission of your instructor.</li>
<li>Extensive use of materials from assignments in other classes without permission of your instructor.</li>
<li>Fabricating information in news or feature stories, whether for publication or not.</li>
<li>Fabricating sources in news or feature stories, whether for publication or not.</li>
<li>Fabricating quotes in news or feature stories, whether for publication or not.</li>
<li>Lack of full disclosure or permission from editors when controversial reportorial techniques, such as going undercover to get news, are used.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="classroom-misconduct" class="anchor" href="#classroom-misconduct" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Classroom misconduct</h3>

<p>Classroom misconduct includes forgery of class attendance; obstruction or disruption of teaching, including late arrival or early departure; failure to turn off cellular telephones leading to disruption of teaching; playing games or surfing the Internet on laptop computers unless instructed to do so; physical abuse or safety threats; theft; property damage; disruptive, lewd or obscene conduct; abuse of computer time; repeated failure to attend class when attendance is required; and repeated failure to participate or respond in class when class participation is required.       </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: Entering a classroom late or leaving a classroom before the end of the period can be extremely disruptive behavior. Students are asked to arrive for class on time and to avoid early departures. This is particularly true of large lectures, where late arrivals and early departures can be most disruptive. Instructors have the right to deny students access to the classroom if they arrive late and have the right to dismiss a student from the class for early departures that result in disruptions.                 </p>

<p>Under MU policy, your instructor has the right to ask for your removal from the course for misconduct, disruptive behavior or excessive absences. The instructor then has the right to issue a grade of withdraw, withdraw failing or F. The instructor alone is responsible for assigning the grade in such circumstances.</p>

<p>When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting or collaboration, consult with your instructor. For closed-book exams and exercises, academic misconduct includes conferring with other class members, copying or reading someone else's test and using notes and materials without prior permission of the instructor. For open-book exams and exercises, academic misconduct includes copying or reading someone else's work.</p>

<p>MU faculty are required to report all instances of academic or classroom misconduct to the appropriate campus officials. Allegations of classroom misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Vice Chancellor for Student Services. Allegations of academic misconduct will be forwarded immediately to MU's Office of the Provost. In cases of academic misconduct, the student will receive at least a zero for the assignment in question.</p>

<h3>
<a id="professional-standards-and-ethics" class="anchor" href="#professional-standards-and-ethics" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Professional standards and ethics</h3>

<p>The School of Journalism is committed to the highest standards of academic and professional ethics and expects its students to adhere to those standards. Students should be familiar with the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists and adhere to its restrictions. Students are expected to observe strict honesty in academic programs and as representatives of school-related media. Should any student be guilty of plagiarism, falsification, misrepresentation or other forms of dishonesty in any assigned work, that student may be subject to a failing grade from the instructor and such disciplinary action as may be necessary under University regulations.</p>

<p>Students may make audio or video recordings of course activity for personal use and review unless specifically prohibited by the faculty member in charge of the class. However, to foster a safe learning environment in which various viewpoints are respected, the redistribution of audio or video recordings or transcripts thereof is prohibited without the written permission of the faculty member in charge of the class and the permission of all students who are recorded.
