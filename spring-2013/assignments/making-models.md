# Quiz 2

For our second quiz, we'll be building a simple Django model.

It is due **by the start of class next Monday, March 11** and should be e-mailed to **chase.davis@gmail.com**. Please submit the results in the form of a Python (.py) file created in your text editor of choice.

## Instructions

The assignment is simple: Below is a sample of a CSV file with some data about campus crime reports. Looking at these fields and their field types, create an appropriate model to fit the data. Don't forget the __unicode__ method.

Hint: If you want to take a closer look at the data, feel free to copy it into Excel.
