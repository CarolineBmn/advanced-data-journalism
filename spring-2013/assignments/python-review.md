# Quiz 1

For our first quiz, we'll be reviewing the basic Python concepts we covered during the first couple weeks of class.

It is due **by the start of class next Monday, Feb. 25** and should be e-mailed to **chase.davis@gmail.com**. For now, you can just submit the results either in a blank text file or in the body of an e-mail.

I will be testing the output of each of your submissions by running them through the interactive Python interpreter we've been using for class. So I would suggest you write your code in the interpreter and copy it into the e-mail or text file once you're sure it works.

Using the internet as a resource is allowed. In fact, it's encouraged. If you can't figure out how to solve one of these problems -- particularly the last couple -- learning how to find the answer on Google is a critical skill to learn. But please, don't copy the code verbatim from any examples you find. You should type your answers out yourself.

## Questions

**Question 1**: Provide a working example of the following data types in Python: string; integer; float; list; tuple; dictionary

**Question 2**: Using the dictionary you created in Question 1, show an example of how you would look up a value using a key (think of the phonebook example we used in class).

**Question 3**: You have a variable, called number, containing an integer value of 5 (```number = 5```). Write a statement that prints "5 or bigger" if the number is greater than or equal to 5 and "Less than 5" if the number is less than five.

**Question 4**: You have a variable, called ```abcs```, containing a list of letters. Write a loop that iterates through and prints out every item in the list.

**Question 5**: You've got a list of numbers, 1 through 10. Create a loop that prints out only the first five numbers from that list.

**Question 6**: This one's a little harder. Start with this list of words:

```
journalists_creed = ['I', 'believe', 'that', 'a', 'journalist', 'should', 'write', 'only', 'what', 'he', 'holds', 'in', 'his', 'heart', 'to', 'be', 'true']
```

Loop through this list and print only the words that start with the letter 'h'.

Here's a hint: Strings can be sliced in much the same way that lists can. So if you have a string variable that looks like this ```word = 'journalist'```, you can retrieve the first letter of that string by looking at its 0 index, just like a list: ```word[0]``` (which will return the string 'j').
