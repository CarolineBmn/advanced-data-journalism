# Quiz 3

For our third quiz, we'll be reviewing Django's query language and some concepts about views.

This will be due **by the end of the day **Friday, April 12** and should be e-mailed to **chase.davis@gmail.com**.

Question 1: What is the function of the urls.py file and how does it relate to views?

For these questions related to the Django query syntax, assume you're working with the same models we used for our Crime application. 

Question 2: How would you retrieve all crimes from the database?

Question 3: How would you retrieve all crimes of type 'TRAFFIC'?

Question 4: How would you retrieve all crimes with a type that starts with the letter T? (Hint: Check out the Django documentation)

Question 5: Build a view that retrieves all traffic crimes from the database and passes them to a template called traffic-crimes.html (Hint: Don't forget to import your models and shortcuts first).
