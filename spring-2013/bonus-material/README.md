# Bonus material

For folks who are feeling adventurous, here is some bonus material that can help supplement the work we're doing in class. I'll continue to add to this based on interest as the semester goes on.

## Python tutorials

It's important to note that this class only scratches the surface of what's possible with Python. Beyond the things we'll be covering, concepts like exception handling; dealing with CSVs and other files; a deeper dive into object-oriented programming; regular expressions; and character encoding are all worth further study. You'll find guides to those topics (and others) below. As always, the best way to learn these things is by applying them to a practical project, so I've included some resources about web scraping as well.

- [Codecademy Python tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python): Great resource to review simple Python concepts and be introduced to several ideas that will be outside the scope of this class.
- [LearnPython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/): Another great resource, similar to Codecademy.
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/): They're lying. It really isn't that hard.
- [PythonJournos Github repository](https://github.com/PythonJournos/LearningPython/wiki/WebScraping): Useful resources specifically geared toward web scraping for programmer journalists. A little old, but still good.
- [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0): This book has some great examples of things like web scraping, as well as a high-level overview of how code fits into various parts of journalism.
- [ScraperWiki tutorials](https://scraperwiki.com/docs/python/): More web scraping examples and exercises.

## Django tutorials

- [The djangoproject.com tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/): The canonical tutorial for people just getting started with Django.
- [IRE's First Newsapp project](https://github.com/ireapps/first-news-app): The app we use most years to teach Django at NICAR conferences.
- [Andy Boyle's Django tutorials](http://www.andymboyle.com/django-tutorials/): Django tutorials by Andy Boyle from the Chicago Tribune.
- [Django screencasts](https://code.djangoproject.com/wiki/DjangoScreencasts): A list of Django tutorials in video form!

## Other tools and techniques worth learning

There's a lot you can do with a basic grasp of Python and Django, but there are a lot more skills that go building great news apps. Among them:

- [Javascript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) and [jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery): Javascript and its jQuery framework form the basis of most of the frontend programming that goes into news apps. As more and more of app interactivity is offloaded to the client side, these are valuable langauges to learn. Codecademy does a great job.
- [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/): The leading data visualization packages for Javascript. Both sites come with great example code.
- [HTML](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/html-one-o-one) and [CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/courses/css-coding-with-style): CSS is what gives modern HTML layouts their look and feel. Again, Codecademy is a good start.
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/): Love it or hate it, the folks at Twitter have come up with some fantastic shortcuts for creating well-designed (if not unique) cross-browser-friendly layouts. I use this for prototyping all the time. Comes with great examples, too.
