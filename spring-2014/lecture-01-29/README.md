# Lecture 1/29/14

In class today, we're going to talk a bit about breaking down programming problems, which is a process I'll be referring back to throughout the semester. For homework, you'll have a quick series of screencasts reviewing the basics of Excel as well as a short writing assignment.

## Homework

In addition to the Excel review (see the excel-basics folder), we'd also like you to write a short description of how you'd approach the following problem, using some of the approach we talked about in class. It's a tricky problem, and there's no right solution. We're just want to see how you'd approach it.

**The problem:** Say you've got a large list of individual crime reports, not unlike the [data](http://www.gocolumbiamo.com/PSJC/Services/911/911dispatch/police-data-include.php) available on the Columbia Police Department's website. Given a couple years of that data, how would you go about writing a program to identify crimes that are unusual or outside the norm?

No need to go too far into detail. Just a couple paragraphs is fine. Please send to chase.davis@gmail.com before class time on Monday.
