# Excel basics

Contains materials for our quick review of Excel. If you have any questions, or anything seems unclear, either bring it up in class or send me an e-mail at chase.davis@gmail.com.

Screencasts can be found on Blackboard under the Tools Area (on the left hand nav bar) and the "Course Gallery" section. It's kind of a pain to find, so we'll go over it in class.

This isn't intended to make you an Excel expert. Mostly, we expect you to understand basic sorting/filtering and know how to work with CSVs.
