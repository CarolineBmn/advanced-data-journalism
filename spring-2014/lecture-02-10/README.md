# Lecture 2/03/14

Today we went over some of the command line material from last week and began talking about Python, where we're going to be spending most of our time in this course. There will be a few screencasts available covering the interactive interpreter, variables and data types, which you should be familiar with by Wednesday.

Also available here is a Python basics document I've used in a couple classes and workshops. Feel free to use it as a reference.
