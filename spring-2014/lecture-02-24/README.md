# Lecture 2/14/14

Today you'll be receiving your first programming assignment, which will require you to do basic cleanup on some campaign finance data from New York City.

The two files you'll need for the assignment can be found in this directory. You can download them directly to your hard drives or just copy the text/code out into local versions. Just be sure to store them in the same directory on your machines.

You'll see some code already in the clean-donors.py file, which you should leave in place. I've marked the area where you should perform the actual cleaning (though if you want to put it somewhere else, that's fine too). You'll also find further instructions in the comments at the top of that file.

This assignment will be due **Wednesday, March 5** and should be e-mailed to chase.davis@gmail.com.

Feel free to collaborate, use Google, or use other resources you think might help. As with most problems in data journalism, there isn't one "right" way to approach this. As long as the output is correct, that's all you need to worry about.

Hint: This [Python cheat sheet](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/spring-2014/lecture-02-10/python-basics.md) might also come in handy.
