# API assignment

In this assignment, you're going to do some simple work to interact with and parse data from the Sunlight Foundation's [OpenStates API](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/openstates-api/).

To make things a little more interesting, we're also going to use this assignment to introduce the concept of functions, which can be useful ways of organizing your code. We'll talk about them a bit in class, but think of them as small, specific purpose tools, not unlike some of the objects we've been using from Python's standard library up to this point.

Your job will be to implement one function, ```get_bills()```, that will retrieve and parse a response from the API. The requirements for each of these functions is outlined in the api.py file in this directory.

To get started, you should sign up for a Sunlight Labs API key. I've included mine in the assignment, just in case, but you should use your own.

The assignment is due **Friday, April 10.** Good luck!
