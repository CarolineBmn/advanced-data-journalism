# Class 3 (Friday, Aug. 28, 2015)

Today we'll talk a bit about version control and get started with the basics of the command line.

If you have a Mac, I'd recommend downloading [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), which is a slightly more user-friendly version of the built-in OSX command-line terminal. If you're using Windows, you'll need to download and install [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), which allows you to use OSX/Linux-style terminal commands. We'll give you a hand if you need help.

## Assignment

This one's easy. Sign up for a [Github](https://github.com/) account if you don't have one already. And then put it in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wvMOJUP32nPWA1d1NzH7i1MxwdQv0P7d2_PHsqKN7Q8/edit#gid=0), along with your name, by the time class starts on Monday.
