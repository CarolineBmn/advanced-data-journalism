# Class 28 (Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015)

Today we'll begin to discuss the basics of the next unit: data analysis using Python. If you want to get a head start, download and install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) and [agate](http://agate.readthedocs.org/en/1.0.1/), which we'll use in class going forward.
