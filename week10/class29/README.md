# Class 27 (Monday, Oct. 26, 2015)

A few things on tap today.

First we'll go over the [solution](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/assignments/scraping/results-scraper.py) to the scraping assignment. Then we'll wrap up our discussion of APIs. You'll receive your [API assignment](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/tree/master/assignments/apis), and with any time remaining we'll begin to discuss the next unit: doing basic data analysis using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [iPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).
