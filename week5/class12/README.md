# Class 12 (Monday, Sept. 21, 2015)

Now that we've gone over the [Python basics](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/week3/class6/python-basics.md), today we'll move on to doing some real work: namely, using the fundamentals we've learned to start cleaning some data.

More often than not, data you obtain from public agencies or online APIs/websites needs a bit of cleanup before you can properly analyze it in a spreadsheet or a database. Python is a great tool for doing just that.

Today we'll talk about dealing with CSV files, which are the most common format in which you will receive data, and applying simple string functions to do basic data cleanup. Pay attention, because you'll be appying many of these same skills in a data cleaning assignment later this week.
