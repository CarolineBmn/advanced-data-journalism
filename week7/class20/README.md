# Class 20 (Friday, Oct. 9, 2015)

We'll keep working on the new [NYC scraper](https://github.com/cjdd3b/advanced-data-journalism/blob/master/week7/class19/scraper.py) is done, using it as an excuse to introduce some more advanced scraping concepts, such as filling out forms with [mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/).

If you haven't already, you should install mechanize by typing **pip install mechanize** or **sudo pip install mechanize** depending on your system setup.
