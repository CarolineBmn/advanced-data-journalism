Today we'll start talking in-depth about APIs, which are simple services that (among many other things) allow you to grab data from the web in a structured format -- thereby bypassing the many inconveniences of scraping.

This lesson, which will be shorter than the scraping and data cleaning segments, will draw on your knowledge of the request/response cycle and passing parameters to URLs. It's also worth reading a bit about [REST](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-http-and-rest--net-16340), which is the fancy computer word for the way these APIs work.
